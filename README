* What is wldbg

wldbg is a tool, that allows you to hijack wayland's connection
and do whatever you want with it. It can be easily extended
by passes or it can run in interactive gdb-like mode.

* What is pass?

The calling pass is inspired by LLVM passes.
Pass is a plugin that defines two functions - one for incoming
messages from client and the other for messages from server.
It can modify, print or take arbitrary action with the message and
then pass the message to another pass and so on..
